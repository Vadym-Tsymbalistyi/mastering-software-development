# ðŸ’¾ Mastering Software Development ðŸ’¾

---


### ðŸ’¡ Project idea:

This repository contains two books, namely: Introducing Python and Computer Science. 

---
### ðŸ“– Outline:
Part I (Chapters 1â€“11) explains Pythonâ€™s basics. You should read these chapters in
order. I work up from the simplest data and code structures, combining them on the
way into more detailed and realistic programs. Part II (Chapters 12â€“22) shows how
Python is used in specific application areas such as the web, databases, networks, and
so on; read these chapters in any order you like.

The Self-Taught Computer Scientist introduces beginner and self-taught programmers to computer science fundamentals that
are essential for success in programming and software engineering fields. This book does not aim to cover everything you
would learn about if you went to school to get a computer science degree. Instead, Cory's goal is to give you an 
introduction to some of the most important concepts in computer science that apply to a programming career. 
With a focus on data structures and algorithms, The Self-Taught Computer Scientist helps you fill gaps in your 
knowledge, prepare for a technical interview, feel knowledgeable and confident on the job, and ultimately, 
become a better programmer.
- Learn different algorithms including linear and binary search and test your knowledge with feedback loops
- Understand what a data structure is and study arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary trees, binary heaps, and graphs
- Prepare for technical interviews and feel comfortable working with more experienced colleagues
